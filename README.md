# F5 AWS Auto Scaling Day-2 Management Demo

A continuation of the [F5 Warm Pool Demo Repository](https://github.com/tylerhatton/f5-warm-pool-demo). This is a basic demonstration of how [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) in conjunction with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and [F5 AS3](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/) can be used to manage changes on a group of F5 BIG-IPs running in an auto scaling group configuration.
